# Base

The "base" directory is for components, functions, or any other element that is
used frequently throughout client code. For example, the `App.jsx` component is
used by the default or index route of the application and contains the Shell,
providers, or context other components in the project will need.

The `fef-server` does not require any specific structure here, so the structure
here is based entirely on the project's needs.

*NOTE: This README file is for reference when starting a project and can be
