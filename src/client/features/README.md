# Features

Multiple "feature" directories can be found here. The `fef-server` framework
does not require a specific structure here, so directories here are based
entirely on the needs of the project.

In terms of of the types of directories here, a project have directories for:

- A specific route in the frontend application.
  - **Example:** A project allows a user to view personal and organizational
    settings. The personal settings could be accessed via `/settings/personal`
    and the organizational via `/settings/organization`. Each route would have
    its own feature directory.
- A component that is used across the application.
  - **Example:** A notification widget that can show up on multiple different
    pages.
